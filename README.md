# Pill_Buddy
Store Medications 
Pill Buddy is code to help users store medications and keep track of daily doses. Soon I will add more to this code to store how much 
the user should take and a reminder on when to take the medication.

Pill Buddy does not have a maximum amount of medication it can store but suggested to store medication for users who may need to check on 
what medications are currently prescribed.
